# Image to ASCII

Just a simple Image to ASCII

## How it works

I used [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) to read images, averaged the RGB values and associated with it with a set "Density".
When starting the program it asks for a filename (the image needs to be in the same directory as the executable) and it needs to be a png or a jpg.

## About the code

I made this in C using GCC (version 11.2.0)
