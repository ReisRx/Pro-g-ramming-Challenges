# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a kids game to help learn about division but is often used on coding interviews

## How it works

It starts on the number "1" and keeps going *BUT* when a number is divisible by 3 it is replaced by the word ***fizz*** and when a number is divisible by five it is replaced with the word ***buzz***. Numbers divisible by *both* is ***fizz buzz***.
